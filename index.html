                <h1>Introduction</h1>

                <p>I'm a technical polyglot, with a focus on .NET but often do everything from server-side to client-side to dev-ops.</p>
                <p>I've consulted, lead development, and worked directly with industry leaders like General Mills, Hy-Vee, Medtronic, Purina and Hallmark. </p>
                <p>I have a strong focus on quality and consistency when it comes to both code and user experience. I always advocate for the end user which, as history serves me, results in successful projects. I meet clients where they are, strive for honest conversation, and inevitably build trust, especially with existing development teams.</p>
                <p>In the fast paced service industry, I've failed a billion times at everything from architecture to client relations and each time I've learned something valuable. I have opinions and I'm quick to challenge assertions. I speak up but I know when to salute and move on.</p>
